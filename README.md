[Google Keep instructions](https://github.com/Nekmo/gkeep/blob/develop/README.rst)

The user will need to create a txt file with their credentials in it called `auth.txt`::
  <username>  <password>
  
For example::

    jnt303 mypassword1234

You can also use the ``--auth`` parameter to set the path to the file with the credentials::

    gkeep --auth /path/to/auth.txt
